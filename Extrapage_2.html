    <h1>Photo taken at Hunter College with a high low shutter speed.</h1>

     <p><strong>For this picture I wanted to capture the motion of students during rush hour heading to class and displaying how busy this big campus can get. Despite the picture not being clear and sharp, this image through its blur tells you that at Hunter you must stay on your feet and how many students you come across everyday. Its tonal range was modified to show fast moving bright colors, as you are flashed by different types of dressing styles and cultures with their rich skin tones and colors.Most pictures capture still moments this time I want the viewer to be apart of that moment with what it is like for students to get from one class to another and coming across several faces in just a few hours.</strong></p>
