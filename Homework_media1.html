     <h1>Fernando Mora's Response to Pluto's Cave</h1>
    <p>Reading "Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag which focuses on the role of photography in modern society which aligns with how a perspective can change ones reality. Plato's Cave is the story about how prisoners see shadow's of objects and base their view and see it as reality, which is what Susan Sontag argues photography does the same thing in the way that the photographer is selecting the objects to display to the viewer. This creates a distorted reality because the photographer is choosing to change a viewers reality depending on the photo. By choosing what to display images can become substitutes for reality rather than representations of it. The photographer selects what objects, people, or moments to capture, and by doing so decides what the viewer is allowed to view. This creates an alternate reality because the photographer is actively shaping the viewer’s understanding of the world through a single frame. Susan also mentions how while photography can be used for good, it should also be taken with a grain of salt because it can be manipulated to portray negative perspectives to which media and people can easily consume. The media in todays society is a powerful tool that can sway opinions and change the state of the world whether that is a good thing or a bad thing. What differs from the story is that photography is not neutral or natural. Sontag suggest that intentional image-making should be brought into consideration when people often think of photos being a simple documentation of moments. Each photo is carefully chosen, directed, and edited to determine what stays in frame and what is marked up. These edits shape the meaning just as much as words would, yet this makes me realize how my own habits while shooting photos can influence others perspective on a situation or event. What I choose to capture and share can play a different meaning to the people I share. Furthermore, image-making and photography can be such a powerful tool to represent the world as it can or could exist in any moment. For example, documenting social and political issues, everyday life, personal identity, and businesses, but they can also create this false image of reality. Introducing text or illustrations to photography can help counteract false narratives by providing context and lead viewers to have a deeper meaning on said photos. Some may suggest that text can kill the speculation of an image but it can guide viewers to question what they are seeing rather than to passively trust what is being displayed. Illustration can create more subjective interpretation which makes it clear that what is being shown can be a constructed perspective rather than a reality. Additionally, I want to approach photography with more intention than just pointing and shooting at the world. I want to think about what this image can be telling viewers instead of just looking visually appealing, I would like to create a story through images and make viewers ask "whose perspective does this represent?". Sontag's "Plato's Cave" has inspired me to critically analyze images and question all sorts of media, but that I also have the power to create narratives that other people should also question and critique. This semester I will be asked to create multiple media projects using different tools and media forms which have a connection to Sontag's ideas. Such as each project does not exist in isolation but potentially builds upon one another. Being a media maker means that I have the responsibility to be aware of the messages I choose to spread and how it can impact communities and powers lives whether I intended it or not. This relates to the shadows in Plato's Cave which shaped the lives of the prisoner's reality, images can also produce a viewers outlook on topics or memory of an even.</p>
