     <h1>Fernando Mora's Response to Pluto's Cave</h1>
    <p>Reading "Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag which focuses on the role of photography in modern society which aligns with how a perspective can change ones reality. Plato's Cave is the story about how prisoners see shadow's of objects and base their view and see it as reality, which is what Susan Sontag argues photography does the same thing in the way that the photographer is selecting the objects to display to the viewer. This creates a distorted reality because the photographer is choosing to change a viewers reality depending on the photo. Susan also mentions how while photography can be used for good, it should also be taken with a grain of salt because it can be manipulated to portray negative perspectives to which media and people can easily consume.</p>
