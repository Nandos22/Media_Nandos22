    <h1>Photo taken at Hunter College with a high Bokeh effect.</h1>
    <img src="bokeh_1.jpg" style="width:1920px; height:1080px">
     
     <p><strong>I choose this image because I wanted to capture the bokeh effect camera lens have at a certain aperature or F stops which we learned in class. You can see how this photo isolates my subject from the world. I want you to focus on my subject and guess from which world it came from. I think in photography not only can you create your own narrative but you can also invite viewers to make their own narritve such as "why did they capture this?" or "whats so special about photing this subject?" Its nice to create new worlds by one simple image with no context. In this case the student metro cards some students recieve at Hunter college is special since this specific card is no longer used by the MTA. I messed around with the tonal range of the photo and decided to darken the hand and area of the card to highlight the metro-cards yellow and blue iconic colors.</strong></p>
