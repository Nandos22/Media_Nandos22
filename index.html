    <h2>What purpose does this serve?</h2>
    <p>A simple project to show I pay attention in lab.</p>

    <h3>Fernando Mora</h3>
    <p>My interest in media is to display what subjects captured my attention. I often travel a lot and I witness events that I feel others around me should get to see. I carry a camera as it allows me to document my life, but also tap into my creative mind where I can tune photos and videos into my artistic vision. Along with learning how to use a camera and fine-tuning my skills in editing software, I enjoy capturing moments that speak to me which leads to me not having a niche for the type of photography I do. This philosophy keeps me open to new experiences instead of specifically finding "that" moment. Any moment can be special if you are willing to keep an open mind.</p>
